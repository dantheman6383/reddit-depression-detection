# Reddit Depression Symptom Detection

This project is based on [this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1upfgKfIJ5JncWoImdmWRqoDxUv2o-MW0/view?usp=sharing).

## Overview
Using text data from Reddit posts, train a random forest classifer to predict depression symptoms. Evaluate accuracy using LDA and RoBERTa embeddings. 

## Philosophy
Social media has become a popular avenue for users to express their feelings, whether it be joyful photos or passionate criticism. As someone who frequents Reddit, I've noticed that despondent posts are particularly common on the platform, largely due to both the conversational nature of the site and the existence of "sub-reddits", which are communities centered around one topic.

Early detection of symptoms, especially with a nuanced condition like depression, is crucial for treating mental health; this project aims to apply natural language processing to sympyom recognition and mental health research.
